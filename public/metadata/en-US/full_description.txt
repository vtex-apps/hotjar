## About

Hotjar is a powerful tool that reveals the online behavior of your users. With the analytics tools, Hotjar gives you the ‘big picture’ of how to improve your site's user experience and performance/conversion rates.

## Functionalities

- Understand what users want, care about and do on your site by visually representing their clicks, taps and scrolling behavior – which are the strongest indicators of visitor motivation and desire;
- Eliminate guesswork with Recordings of real visitor behavior on your site. By seeing your visitor’s clicks, taps and mouse movements you can identify usability issues on the fly and issues they encounter;
- Find the biggest opportunities for improvement and testing by identifying on which page and at which step most visitors are leaving your site;
- Improve online form completion rates by discovering which fields take too long to ﬁll, which are left blank, and why your visitors abandon your form and page.
